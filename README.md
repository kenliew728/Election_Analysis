## Election-Audit Summary
The written script can be modified to futher extract more information on the election results with additional categories such as gender, age, race, political affiliation, vote history or many more. The data will help each candidate to understand reasons for them winning or loosing an election.

An example of how the script can be modified is to create list and dictionary for any additional categories that need to be counted such as political affiliation or race. Once the list and dictionary are defined, a for loop  can be used to track the total votes by any defined categories. The additional data will help each candidates to analyze and understand where the campaign money needs to be focused on in the next election.
